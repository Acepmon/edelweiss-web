                <p>
                    The health and safety of our customers, florists and growers is top priority. 
                    During this time, we will not require a signature for delivery. 
                    All orders will no longer be hand delivered, but be left at the front door with 
                    no contact and (as always) ready to delight.

                <p>
                    We have a simple goal â€“ delight our customers with flowers that are high quality, fresh, 
                    and beautiful. While we may occasionally need to substitute for color or flower variety, 
                    we promise that the blooms you receive will be fresh and wow you or your gift recipient.
